### Realtime chat app

This is a good project that i completed in a long time in 2-3 days without any break and without much copy paste (except the golang socker code part which i copied directly from the websocket example).

This project was also a promise I made to my long gone friend (after he was gone) and i will continue to improve it and build upon it.


### Current features

1. users can create chat rooms.
2. a telegram notification goes to the registered listeners.
3. users can join a chat room after getting the id
4. some amount of chat data is persisted
5. everything is real time thanks to golang's awesome channel based implementations


### To add

1. people can write blogs etc.
2. add a db to store all data.
3. people can search on the data shared.
4. elastic search integration.
5. python and DL based chatbots so that users can chat about a specific domain.
6. longer chat persistence.
7. more scalable codebase to handle different rooms separately
8. public rooms discussing stuff on topics.
9. more listeners onboarding
10. optimal telegram chat integrations.
11. etc etc


Some private and important data is shared in the codebase but who cares, its not that private

everything is ephemeral just like our lives, better make it meaningful.
